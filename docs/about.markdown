Edward is a Software Developer with a passion for understanding things deeply
and all things Python.

He holds a Bachelor’s in Computer Science & Math from SUNY Potsdam and a
Master’s in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin.

He is drawn to the intersection of technology and people and enjoys building
slack bots, dashboards, and integrations. He also likes to stream and record
YouTube videos on math-related programming topics.

In his free time, he loves to play pickleball, attend tech meetups, and throw a
frisbee at the beach (when he gets out to it).
