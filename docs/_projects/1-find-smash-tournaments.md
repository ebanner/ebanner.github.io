# Smash Ultimate Tournament Dashboard

I'm a big fan of [competitive Smash
Ultimate](https://www.start.gg/game/ultimate/all). Though one annoying thing is
I was always finding out about tournaments after they happened. I didn't know
which ones were coming up when.

So I created a dashboard that would query all the tournaments that favorite
players have been in together and sort them by which tournaments have most of my
favorite players competing together.

Here it is:
