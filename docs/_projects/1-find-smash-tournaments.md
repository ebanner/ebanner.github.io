# Smash Ultimate Tournament Dashboard

I'm a big fan of [competitive Smash
Ultimate](https://www.start.gg/game/ultimate/all). But I didn't know what the
major tournaments were and I didn't know where to find them.

So I created a dashboard that would query all the tournaments that favorite
players have been in together and sort them by which tournaments have most of my
favorite players competing together.
