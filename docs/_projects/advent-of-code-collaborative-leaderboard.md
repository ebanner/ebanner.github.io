# Advent of Code Collaborative Leaderboard

This year, I did Advent of Code with [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io)!

The whole experience was super fun, and I built some stuff along the way, which
made it even more fun/special.

### Collaborative Leaderboard

I created a [slackbot](https://github.com/ebanner/advent-of-code-leaderboard)
that would post the problem of the day and a collaborative leaderboard:

It would update throughout the day when someone solved the problem and served as
a place to centralize discussion for that day's problem.

When you solved a problem it would send an alert to that thread saying which
part you solved:

It was super motivating and fun!

### Burnup Chart

After it ended, I created a burnup chart to track progress and recent solves:

Shout out to [Arthur Doler](https://github.com/doleraj) for giving me the idea
to create the burnup chart (he did it first and I totally just copied him).

## Special Thanks

Shout out the `#dev-code-challenges` channel in Virtual Coffee, and in
particular [Arthur Doler](https://github.com/doleraj) and [Ray
Deck](https://raydeck.com). Doing Advent of Code with them absolutely
pushed me further than I would have gone alone, and what I thought I was [capable
of](https://github.com/ebanner/advent-of-code-2024).
