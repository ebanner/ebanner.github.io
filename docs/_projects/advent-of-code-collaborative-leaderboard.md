# Advent of Code Collaborative Leaderboard

This year, I did Advent of Code with [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io)!

The whole experience was super fun, and I built some stuff along the way, which
made it even more fun and special.

### Collaborative Leaderboard

I created a [slackbot](https://github.com/ebanner/advent-of-code-leaderboard)
that posted a message with a collaborative leaderboard headlined with a link to
the problem of the day:

It would update throughout the day when someone got a star. It served as a great
place to centralize discussion for that day's problem.

### Star Alerts

When you got a star, it would send an alert to that thread saying which part you
solved:

I found the alerts super satisfying, motivating, and fun!

### Burnup Chart

After Advent of Code ended, I created a burnup chart to track progress of
everyone and recent stars:

Shout out to [Arthur Doler](https://github.com/doleraj) for giving me the idea
to create the burnup chart (he did it first and I totally just copied him).

## Special Thanks

I want to give a special shout out the `#dev-code-challenges` channel in Virtual
Coffee, and in particular [Arthur Doler](https://github.com/doleraj) and [Ray
Deck](https://raydeck.com). Doing Advent of Code with them absolutely pushed me
further than I would have gone alone, and what I thought I was [capable
of](https://github.com/ebanner/advent-of-code-2024).
