I love the r/awakened slack group - it's a lovely group of people and I love
hanging out there.

Over the years I have built several projects.

### Discord voice room integration

We do Friday Night Hangouts sometimes

We either used a combination of discord or Google Hangouts

This mostly worked fine, but when a call was happening and someone was late, a
common question would be "is it still going on"?

You couldn't see who was in the call or if it was still going on

Slack calls API

Created a discord bot to listen to leave and enter events and update the slack
call

The discord bot is hosted on ECS

The downside of a discord bot is it costs money

Came up with a really cool solution where the call starts up the discord bot on
ECS

And then shuts down the ECS service when the call ends

The call auto-ends when the last person leaves

Leave a one-minute grace period

so I created this Slackbot that allows you
to do `/event <event-name>` and it starts up a Discord call:
