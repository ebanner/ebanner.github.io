title:  "My Custom Keyboard Layout"
---

One of the most original things I've ever done that I think is genuinely
innovative is my custom keyboard layout:

Problems it solves:

Jupyter notebook hitting Shift Enter too many times with pinky

Takes a lot of the keys that would be typed with weak fingers and puts them
for strong fingers

Arch nemesis is still the @ sign.
