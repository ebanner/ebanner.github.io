Stuff piles up and gets stale. I don't want to maintain a file that I have to
find every time I want to append something to it.

So instead of viewing my stuff as a todo list that I need to get through, I view
it as a stream and clear it out on a regular basis.

Here's a video demo of how I do this with [YouTube videos](https://github.com/ebanner/archive-youtube-playlist):

I also do it with [email](https://github.com/ebanner/gmail-auto-archive-daily).

I took original inspriation from the [Obsidian Daily Note](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes) feature.
