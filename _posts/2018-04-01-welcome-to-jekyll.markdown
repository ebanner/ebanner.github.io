Hi all! Welcome to my blog. I am quite excited to finally have a place for
collecting my thoughts and documenting various things.

For a while now I've been meaning to write a few blog posts. Off the top of my
head here are a few things I thought of recently to write about/document.

- My custom keyboard layout
- Spacemacs [hybrid editing mode][spacemacs-hybrid]
- My journey of developing [pynt][pynt]
- The workflow I intend for [pynt][pynt]
- How I built my [ClojureScript app][ygyl-player]
- Using [`edebug`][edebug]
- My journey to [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) (from vim to emacs to vim and back again)

On a general note, as I explore and play with stuff, I increasingly find myself
saying "I should write a blog post on that". This usually comes after I google
something and a *spot-on* result does not come up.

Indeed, several of the things I want to write about include various software
that was painful to get working and would have been less painful if only I had
know a few simple tricks.

For example, just recently I wanted to make a web app with a django backend and
clojurescript frontend. There were some github links that came up but no one
detailing their experience creating an app with the two. That's a great idea for
a blog post I think!

So stay tuned for some posts. They are bound to be useful to me at a minimum.
